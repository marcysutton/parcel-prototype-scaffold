# Parcel prototyping demo

This project is an empty scaffolding demo for prototyping JavaScript-heavy web interfaces with the [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) bundler. It requires you to have [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org) installed.

To use this project, clone it from GitHub and install dependencies:
```
git clone git@github.com:/marcysutton/parcel-prototype-scaffold.git parcel-demo
cd parcel-demo
npm install
```

Optionally install your favorite JavaScript UI framework:
```
npm install react react-dom --save
```

Write JavaScript app code in `index.js`, which is already linked in `index.html`. You can import packages and write ES6 code in `index.js`, and Parcel will bundle it for you.

To run Parcel:
```
npm start
```

You can then open the web app in a browser: http://localhost:1234
